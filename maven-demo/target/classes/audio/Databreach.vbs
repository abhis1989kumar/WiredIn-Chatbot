speech.speak "Verizon has reported that 99% of breaches are due to known vulnrabilities. Other sources also reported high numbers (97% by Strategic Software Survey, 90% by SEI, 76% by NTT, and 70% by HPE). However, less than 5% of all known vulnerabilities are used in malicious cyberattacks. It is therefore necessary to explore the criteria according to which malHats choose to exploit one vulnerability over another. At CYR3CON(TM) we more than thought about this. "
